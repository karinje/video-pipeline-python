Same late twenties Mediterranean male stands centered before mirror in close-up, charcoal blazer and white shirt visible. His hands slowly raise the gold SunVue Aviator Classic sunglasses toward his face. As the iconic double-bridge gold frames with G-15 lenses make contact with his face, IMPOSSIBLE MELT TRANSITION OCCURS: The old blurry, desaturated world visible in the mirror begins to liquefy and drip away through the G-15 lenses like melting watercolor paint, revealing underneath a crystal-sharp, vividly colorful version of reality with enhanced clarity and saturation. His squinting uncertain expression simultaneously transforms - furrowed brow relaxes, jaw becomes more defined with confidence, subtle knowing smile emerges, eyes behind G-15 lenses now appear focused and assured.
