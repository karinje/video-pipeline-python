The skybridge is contemporary architecture - floor-to-ceiling glass walls and transparent floor panels showing traffic flowing far below, steel structural beams creating geometric patterns. Harsh afternoon sunlight creates intense reflections and glare on the glass surfaces. As character walks, the chaotic reflections on the glass walls impossibly rearrange themselves - initially fragmented and scattered, they gradually coalesce into a perfect confident silhouette mirror image of the character.
