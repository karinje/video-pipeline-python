They are a 30-year-old professional with warm medium-brown skin tone with olive undertones, thick dark brown hair in modern professional cut, wearing a tailored charcoal gray blazer over crisp white dress shirt with top button undone. They carry a tan leather messenger bag where SunVue Aviator Classic sunglasses are tucked inside (gold-toned frames with gray-green polarized lenses partially visible).

The city street behind them is washed out with harsh overexposed highlights and blown-out bright areas, buildings with indistinct details in the challenging brightness.\n\nCinematography:\nCamera shot: Medium-wide shot at eye level, capturing character from waist up with office building glass exterior visible behind them and urban street in background\nCamera motion: Slow steady dolly forward, following the character as they exit building and step into street\nLighting: Harsh intense golden hour sunlight from right side creating strong directional light, uncomfortable glare washing across face and glass building surfaces, overexposed highlights with blown-out bright areas, natural lens flare\nMood: Uncomfortable and hesitant, overwhelmed by harsh light, uncertain and slightly frustrated\n\nActions:\n- Character pushes through glass doors and steps outside (0-1.5 sec)\n- Harsh sunlight hits face, they immediately squint with eyes partially closed (1.5-3 sec)\n- Hand reaches up toward face to shield from glare, body language shows discomfort (3-4.5 sec)\n- Takes two steps forward into street, still squinting, hesitant expression visible (4.5-6 sec)",

They are the same 30-year-old with warm medium-brown skin, dark brown hair, charcoal blazer, but now with confident posture, shoulders back, relaxed facial expression. As their hands settle the frames perfectly on their nose bridge and the polarized lenses align with their eyes, the urban street environment undergoes a dramatic 'melt transition' - the harsh washed-out glare literally appears to liquefy and dissolve away like water or melting glass. The visual effect shows harsh bright overexposed areas softening and flowing downward, revealing the transformed world underneath. Within 2 seconds, the urban street shifts from harsh golden hour glare (blown-out highlights, hazy indistinct details, uncomfortable brightness) to crystalline sharp focus with polarized clarity (rich saturated colors - deep blues in sky, vibrant reds and oranges in storefronts, vivid greens in urban plantings, razor-sharp architectural details, balanced exposure with no glare). Every element becomes more alive and dimensional - neon murals explode with intense color, building edges become crisp and defined, window reflections show clear detail.
