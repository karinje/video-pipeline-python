**CONCEPT TITLE**: Celebrity by Accident

**EYEWEAR FOCUS**:
- Frame Style: Aviators, Wayfarers, Cat-Eyes
- Lens Type: Premium UV protection lenses with color-shifting technology
- Style Persona: Effortlessly iconic, reality-bending presence, accidental influencer

**REVISED 5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:

**SCENE 1**: Office worker grabs SunVue Aviators from desk, heads to lunch. As frames slide on, surroundings subtly transform—walls turn velvet, lighting becomes golden.

**SCENE 2**: At coffee shop, barista gasps, offers free latte. Other customers snap photos while protagonist awkwardly orders sandwich—reflections in lenses show paparazzi that aren't there.

**SCENE 3**: Walking outside, real paparazzi swarm. Doorman rushes over with velvet rope, creating VIP path to grocery store.

**SCENE 4**: In produce aisle, manager appears with champagne. Confused shopper switches to Cat-Eyes—suddenly everyone treats them like different celebrity archetype.

**SCENE 5**: Removes sunglasses at checkout. Reality snaps back to normal fluorescent lighting. "Wait, who are you?" Shrugs, puts SunVue back on—instant transformation returns.

**AUDIENCE JOURNEY**: Viewers laugh at the absurd power of great frames while secretly wanting that same instant elevation and reality-shifting confidence.

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: SunVue frames don't just protect your eyes—they transform your entire presence and perception. The comedy highlights how the right sunglasses can make anyone look like somebody, proving that iconic style changes how you see and are seen.

**TAGLINE/END CARD**: Hero adjusts all three SunVue styles in mirror. Each triggers different reality shift. "See Different. Be Different."

**REVISION SUMMARY**: Added subtle AI-friendly reality transformations (golden lighting shifts, false reflections in lenses) to leverage video generation potential while keeping core narrative intact. Introduced frame-switching in Scene 4 to showcase product variety and appeal to broader demographics. Replaced "Never Hide" with "See Different. Be Different." to better connect with the transformation narrative and brand's fresh perspective value.
