  "original_score": 78,
  "weaknesses_addressed": [
    "Doesn't fully leverage AI video generation potential - could include more reality-bending transformations",
    "Mistaken celebrity trope has been used before in advertising, reducing freshness factor",
    "May not resonate equally across all demographics - humor skews toward younger urban audiences",
    "The 'Never Hide' tagline feels disconnected from the mistaken identity narrative"
  ],
  "strengths_maintained": [
    "Excellent narrative arc with clear cause-and-effect showing the transformative power of the sunglasses",
    "Strong emotional resonance through relatable humor and wish-fulfillment fantasy",
    "Natural brand integration where the product is central to the story's entire premise",
    "Highly memorable concept with the instant on/off celebrity status creating a sticky visual hook",
    "Clear, distinct scenes that would translate well to a 30-60 second format"
