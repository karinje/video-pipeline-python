  "original_score": 82,
  "weaknesses_addressed": [
    "Wearing three pairs simultaneously in the ending undermines product credibility",
    "Rapid style switching between three different frames might dilute focus on individual products",
    "The 'Never Hide' tagline doesn't clearly connect to the reality transformation concept",
    "May appeal more to younger audiences, potentially limiting broader market reach"
  ],
  "strengths_maintained": [
    "Excellent use of AI capabilities with reality transformations that would be impossible to film traditionally",
    "Clear product differentiation showing how each frame style creates a distinct personality/vibe",
    "Highly relatable premise of escaping mundane office life resonates universally",
    "Strong visual progression with each transformation becoming more surreal and memorable",
    "Natural brand integration where the glasses literally drive the narrative transformation"
