**CONCEPT TITLE**: Reality Remix Revolution

**EYEWEAR FOCUS**:
- Frame Style: Aviators, Wayfarers, Cat-Eyes
- Lens Type: Premium tinted lenses with UV protection
- Style Persona: The Reality Transformer - Bold, playful, confidence-boosting

**5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:

**SCENE 1**: Exhausted office worker stares at grey cubicle walls. Discovers sleek SunVue case on desk, opens it curiously.

**SCENE 2**: Puts on Aviators. Office transforms into rooftop party - boss DJs, water cooler bubbles champagne, everyone's dancing.

**SCENE 3**: Switches to Wayfarers. Reality shifts to tropical beach office - desks become tiki bars, photocopiers shoot confetti.

**SCENE 4**: Tries Cat-Eyes. World goes wonderfully weird - plants salsa dance, emails fly as paper airplanes, ceiling becomes sky.

**SCENE 5**: Takes glasses off. Everything snaps back to boring grey. Grins, puts all three pairs on simultaneously.

**AUDIENCE JOURNEY**: Viewers laugh at the absurd transformations while connecting with the universal desire to escape mundane reality through bold style choices.

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: The concept literally shows how the right frames change your entire perspective, making SunVue the hero of personal transformation. Each style delivers a distinct vibe, proving these aren't just sunglasses - they're portable attitude adjusters that make life more fun.

**TAGLINE/END CARD**: Logo appears as character struts out wearing all three frames stacked. "SunVue. Never Hide."
