**CONCEPT TITLE**: Reality Remix Revolution

**EYEWEAR FOCUS**:
- Frame Style: Aviators, Wayfarers, Cat-Eyes
- Lens Type: Premium tinted lenses with UV protection
- Style Persona: The Reality Transformer - Bold, playful, confidence-boosting

**REVISED 5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:

**SCENE 1**: Exhausted office worker stares at grey cubicle walls. Discovers sleek SunVue case on desk, opens it curiously.

**SCENE 2**: Puts on Aviators. Office transforms into rooftop party - boss DJs, water cooler bubbles champagne, everyone's dancing.

**SCENE 3**: Switches to Wayfarers. Reality shifts to tropical beach office - desks become tiki bars, photocopiers shoot confetti.

**SCENE 4**: Tries Cat-Eyes. World goes wonderfully weird - plants salsa dance, emails fly as paper airplanes, ceiling becomes sky.

**SCENE 5**: Takes glasses off. Everything snaps back. Chooses favorite pair (Wayfarers), smiles confidently, walks out transformed.

---

**AUDIENCE JOURNEY**: Viewers laugh at the absurd transformations while connecting with the universal desire to escape mundane reality through bold style choices.

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: The concept literally shows how the right frames change your entire perspective, making SunVue the hero of personal transformation. Each style delivers a distinct vibe, proving these aren't just sunglasses - they're portable attitude adjusters that make life more fun.

**TAGLINE/END CARD**: Logo appears as character struts out wearing chosen frames. "SunVue. Transform Your View."

**REVISION SUMMARY**: Changed ending from wearing three pairs simultaneously to choosing one favorite pair, maintaining product credibility while showing personal preference. Replaced "Never Hide" tagline with "Transform Your View" to directly connect to the reality transformation concept. All other elements preserved as they were working well - the multi-generational appeal comes from the universal office escape fantasy, not age-specific humor.
