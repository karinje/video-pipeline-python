**5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:

**SCENE 1**: In a washed-out city commute, our character squints at glare, clutching SunVue Aviator Classics, feeling invisible and stuck.

**SCENE 2**: They put on the gold Aviator Classics; G-15 lenses cut glare, colors intensify, their posture straightens with quiet certainty.

**SCENE 3**: Striding through the city, reflections glide across polarized lenses as confident strangers nod, outfits and street art suddenly vibrant.

**SCENE 4**: Driving toward the coast, sunlight bounces harmlessly off the windshield; they smirk, adjusting the Aviators like a personal signature.

**SCENE 5**: On a sunlit overlook, they remove then re-don Aviators; world dulls then blooms, locking in: “SunVue. The world, in focus.”

**AUDIENCE JOURNEY**: Viewers move from feeling dulled and overlooked to experiencing magnetic, timeless confidence that seems to live inside these Aviators.

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: The SunVue Aviator Classic isn’t just protection; it’s the switch that turns down glare and turns up self-belief. By tying richer color, social recognition, and effortless cool directly to the polarized lenses, the frames become an essential part of how you move through the world.

**TAGLINE/END CARD**: Character stands foreground, SunVue Aviator Classics dominating frame as logo appears: “SunVue – See Clear. Be Seen.”
