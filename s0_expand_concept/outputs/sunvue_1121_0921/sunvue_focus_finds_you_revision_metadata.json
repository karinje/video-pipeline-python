  "original_score": 78,
  "weaknesses_addressed": [
    "Concept feels formulaic and safe - the 'put on product, world transforms, gain confidence' structure is an eyewear advertising clich\u00e9 that lacks surprise",
    "Underutilizes AI video generation potential - no impossible visuals, reality-bending effects, or transformations that would create a unique visual hook beyond standard color grading",
    "Emotional journey is somewhat predictable and surface-level - confidence boost is expected rather than deeply felt or nuanced",
    "Scene 4 (driving to coast) feels disconnected from urban setting and adds length without advancing the core narrative meaningfully",
    "Tagline 'See Clear. Be Seen.' is generic and could apply to any eyewear brand - misses opportunity for distinctive brand voice"
  ],
  "strengths_maintained": [
    "Clear narrative progression from dull invisibility to magnetic confidence with coherent five-scene structure that flows naturally",
    "Excellent product integration - the Aviator Classics are the catalyst for transformation, with specific lens technology (G-15 polarized) organically tied to both functional and emotional benefits",
    "Strong visual contrast between washed-out Scene 1 and vibrant Scenes 3-5 creates compelling before/after that's easy to picture",
    "The remove/re-don moment in Scene 5 cleverly demonstrates product value while reinforcing the tagline",
    "Target audience alignment is precise - 'Timeless Cool' persona matches the classic aviator heritage and appeals to aspirational confidence seekers"
