**REVISED 5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:

**SCENE 1**: Average person juggling grocery bags, stressed; reflection shows frazzled. They slide on gold Aviators—reflection flips to iconic, hyper-confident self.

**SCENE 2**: A rideshare pulls up; driver excitedly greets them by viral-handle name, referencing their “legendary Aviator look” and five‑star style.

**SCENE 3**: On a bustling sidewalk, people film vertically, tagging them; a live AR-style overlay crowns: “#SunVueLegend” above the Aviator Classics.

**SCENE 4**: At a trendy restaurant, host checks tablet, surprised: their face auto-matches a “Style Icon” profile—VIP access unlocked for the Aviator wearer.

**SCENE 5**: They laugh, lift the Aviator Classics; AR overlays and attention vanish instantly. On-screen line: “Not a celebrity. Just SunVue.” Logo and product hero.

**AUDIENCE JOURNEY**: Viewers watch an everyday person gain effortless, tech-age “icon” treatment, realizing the confidence-shifting power of SunVue Aviator Classics.

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: The sunglasses are the unmistakable trigger for every misunderstanding, clearly elevating an ordinary character into an accidental style icon. SunVue’s timeless Aviator Classics embody rebellious confidence and cultural cool in a creator-driven world, proving that when you wear them, the world—and even the algorithms—see you differently.

**TAGLINE/END CARD**: SunVue Aviator Classic front and center, lenses catching light; text appears: “SunVue. See like you. Be seen like a legend.”

**REVISION SUMMARY**:  
Scene 1 now uses the grocery-bag moment plus a reflection “flip” to visually specify the transformation. Scenes 2–4 keep the mistaken-status arc but shift from old-school celebrity to modern influencer/algorithm recognition, adding an AR-style overlay and app/tablet misidentifications—this both freshens the joke and leverages AI/CG-friendly visuals while keeping the sunglasses as the catalyst. Scene 5 stays structurally the same but adds the disappearance of overlays to create a single, memorable signature moment and a clear comedic payoff.
