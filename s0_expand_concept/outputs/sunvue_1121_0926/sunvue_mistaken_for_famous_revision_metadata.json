  "original_score": 78,
  "weaknesses_addressed": [
    "The concept follows a familiar advertising formula (ordinary person transformed by product) that has been executed many times, reducing novelty",
    "Doesn't fully exploit AI video generation capabilities - the scenes could be shot traditionally without requiring impossible visuals or transformations",
    "The humor relies on a single joke repeated across multiple scenes, which may feel repetitive rather than building momentum",
    "The 'mistaken for famous' premise may feel less aspirational in an era where influencer culture has democratized celebrity status",
    "Scene 1's 'subtly transformed' moment lacks specificity - what exactly changes visually to signal the transformation?"
  ],
  "strengths_maintained": [
    "Excellent brand integration - the Aviator Classics are the clear catalyst for every interaction, making them essential rather than decorative",
    "Strong narrative arc with coherent progression from ordinary moment to celebrity treatment to self-aware punchline",
    "Clear visual distinction between scenes (grocery store, valet, sidewalk, restaurant, reveal) makes it easy to picture as a 60-second spot",
    "Emotionally accessible concept that balances aspiration with humor, making viewers feel both empowered and entertained",
    "The tagline 'See like you. Be seen like a legend' perfectly encapsulates the dual benefit and ties directly to the narrative"
