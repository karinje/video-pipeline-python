**REVISED 5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:

**SCENE 1**: Morning commuter waits at dreary bus stop, rain pattering. Discovers sleek SunVue case in bag.

**SCENE 2**: Puts on Aviators. Street transforms: puddles reflect neon lights, strangers share umbrellas, buses become vibrant art pieces.

**SCENE 3**: Switches to Wayfarers. Reality shifts: rain becomes glitter, street musicians appear, everyone's dancing through crosswalks.

**SCENE 4**: Tries Cat-Eyes. World goes playfully surreal: pigeons wear tiny hats, traffic lights wink, buildings sway to unheard rhythm.

**SCENE 5**: Removes glasses. Grey reality snaps back instantly. Grins, puts Aviators back on. World transforms again.
