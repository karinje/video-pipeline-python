  "weaknesses_addressed": [
    "Office setting is somewhat overused in advertising, though the transformations help differentiate",
    "The 'magical glasses' trope has been done before, though rarely with this level of visual ambition",
    "May risk overshadowing the actual product quality/features with fantasy elements"
  ],
  "strengths_maintained": [
    "Exceptional use of AI capabilities with reality transformations that would be impossible to film traditionally",
    "Each frame style gets its own distinct personality and transformation, showcasing product range effectively",
    "Strong emotional journey from mundane to magical that viewers will relate to",
    "Memorable visual hook with instant transformation mechanic that reinforces brand message",
    "Natural brand integration where the product literally drives the entire narrative"
