## YOUR TASK

**CRITICAL PRINCIPLE:**
The MORE changes you make, the MORE risk you introduce NEW weaknesses. Be surgical, not radical.

Address the identified weaknesses with **AS FEW CHANGES AS POSSIBLE**.

### YOUR APPROACH

1. **Analyze each weakness** - what's the MINIMUM change needed to fix it?
2. **Preserve everything that's working** (the strengths)
3. **Only modify what's necessary** to address the specific issues raised
4. **Ask yourself**: "Will this change introduce new problems?"
5. **If a weakness requires major changes** to fix, consider whether it's worth the risk

### REMEMBER

- The original concept scored {{total_score}}/100, so most of it is working
- Don't reinvent the concept unless absolutely necessary
- Small, targeted fixes are safer than dramatic overhauls
- Your goal is to improve the score, not create an entirely new concept

### REVISION PRIORITIES

- If **Narrative Quality** was weak: Strengthen story arc and pacing (minimal changes)
- If **Emotional Impact** was weak: Add subtle relatable moments (don't change the whole story)
- If **Brand Integration** was weak: Make frames slightly more central (don't rewrite scenes)
- If **Memorability** was weak: Add one signature moment (don't change everything)
- If **Visual Clarity** was weak: Clarify descriptions (don't change the concept)
- If **Success Likelihood** was weak: Make small commercial adjustments (keep the core)

### MAINTAIN EYEWEAR ESSENTIALS

- Frames clearly visible in at least 3 scenes
- Include one "putting on glasses" moment
- Show style transformation or confidence boost
- Keep frame style consistent ({{FRAME_STYLE}})

### DO NOT INCLUDE

- Camera angles or shot types
- Lighting descriptions
- Technical production details
- Visual effects specifics

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Read the original concept carefully**
2. **Read the identified weaknesses**
3. **For EACH weakness, determine the minimum change needed to address it**
4. **Make your changes while preserving what's working**
5. **Ensure scenes are appropriately paced for {{clip_duration}} seconds each**
6. **Verify your changes don't introduce new problems**

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the IMPROVED {{num_clips}}-scene concept in the EXACT same format as the input.

**IMPORTANT**: Keep the same structure, keep most scenes similar, only change what's necessary to address weaknesses.

**SCENE 1**: [Minimally revised scene - only change if weakness requires it, 15-20 words max, {{clip_duration}} seconds]

**SCENE 2**: [Minimally revised scene - only change if weakness requires it, 15-20 words max, {{clip_duration}} seconds]

**SCENE 3**: [Minimally revised scene - only change if weakness requires it, 15-20 words max, {{clip_duration}} seconds]

**SCENE 4**: [Minimally revised scene - only change if weakness requires it, 15-20 words max, {{clip_duration}} seconds]
