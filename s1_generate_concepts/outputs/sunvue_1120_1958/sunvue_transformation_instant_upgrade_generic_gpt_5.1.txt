**SCENE 1**: Golden-hour city; young professional exits glass tower, squinting at traffic glare, smartphone reflection shows tired, ordinary look.  

**SCENE 2**: They pass a boutique; window display zooms in on SunVue Aviator Classic, lenses catching molten-gold skyline reflections.  

**SCENE 3**: Close-up as they put on SunVue aviators; city instantly sharpens, polarized lenses erase windshield glare, colors deepen dramatically.  

**SCENE 4**: Montage: confident drive through traffic, rooftop meet-up, spontaneous beach stop; aviators lock in a signature look, heads turning.  

**SCENE 5**: Final golden-hour close-up: aviators glowing with city, road, and waves reflected; logo appears with tagline text on-screen, "SunVue. Never Hide."
