**SCENE 1**: Urban professional walks through glass office building at golden hour, blending invisibly into the crowd of generic business attire.

**SCENE 2**: She pauses at a reflection, pulls out sleek SunVue Aviator case from her bag as warm sunlight floods the frame.

**SCENE 3**: She slides on the classic Aviators and the world shifts—her posture straightens, stride becomes confident, timeless rebel emerging from corporate uniform.

**SCENE 4**: Walking through revolving doors into golden hour cityscape, every head turns as she moves with effortless cool, reflections dancing in polarized lenses.

**SCENE 5**: She looks directly at camera, removes frames with a knowing smile—"Never Hide"—then slides them back on and disappears into her legendary day.
