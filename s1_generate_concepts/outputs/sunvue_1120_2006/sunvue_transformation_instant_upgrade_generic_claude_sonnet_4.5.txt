**SCENE 1**: Urban professional exits office building at sunset, squinting against harsh glare, blending into the corporate crowd—just another face.

**SCENE 2**: Walking past reflective storefront, catches own washed-out reflection, pauses—something feels incomplete about the look.

**SCENE 3**: Reaches into jacket pocket, slides on SunVue Aviator Classics—golden hour light catches the frames' perfect angles.

**SCENE 4**: Instant transformation—confident stride emerges, city reflects perfectly in polarized lenses, heads turn as style clicks into place.

**SCENE 5**: Frame freezes on that signature rebel smirk, Aviators gleaming—"SunVue. Never Hide." The frames that complete you.
