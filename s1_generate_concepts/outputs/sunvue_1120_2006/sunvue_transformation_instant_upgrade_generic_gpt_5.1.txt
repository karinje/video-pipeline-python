**SCENE 1**: An overworked young professional trudges through downtown at golden hour, squinting against glare, blending into crowds.  

**SCENE 2**: He pauses at a sleek street kiosk; through SunVue Aviator Classics, harsh reflections soften into ultra-clear, golden city views.  

**SCENE 3**: He slips on the Aviators; golden light flares, his outfit sharpens, posture straightens, city colors intensify.  

**SCENE 4**: Montage: rooftop meeting, convertible drive, beach boardwalk, airport lounge—each lens reflection crisp, glare-free, broadcasting effortless, timeless cool.  

**SCENE 5**: Final close-up: he lowers the frames, smirks at camera; SunVue logo appears beside them—“Never Hide” in glowing script.
