**SCENE 1**: Golden hour in the city; a young professional exits the office, squinting, outfit sharp but expression drained.  

**SCENE 2**: He pauses by a street-side display; SunVue Aviator Classics glow in the window, lenses catching molten golden-hour reflections.  

**SCENE 3**: He slips on the polarized Aviators; city glare melts away as colors deepen, posture straightens, half-smile appears.  

**SCENE 4**: Walking through traffic, lenses mirror shifting scenes—sunlit highway, rooftop beach party, airport runway—each reflection starring his unmistakable look.  

**SCENE 5**: Close-up on SunVue Aviator Classic frames catching final sun flare as onscreen text appears: “SunVue. Polarized precision. Never Hide.”
