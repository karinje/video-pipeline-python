**AUDIENCE JOURNEY**: Viewers recognize that moment of feeling invisible in professional life, then experience the visceral transformation that the right frames create.

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: The Aviators become the catalyst for complete presence transformation, showing both functional benefits (eliminating squinting/glare) and style power (commanding attention). The golden hour lighting makes the gold frames and G-15 lenses the heroes, demonstrating why these specific glasses matter. The "Never Hide" tagline lands perfectly as the character stops hiding in the crowd and owns their space.

**TAGLINE/END CARD**: Close-up of gold Aviators on table reflecting sunset, SunVue logo appears with "Never Hide" as confident hand reaches to put them back on.
