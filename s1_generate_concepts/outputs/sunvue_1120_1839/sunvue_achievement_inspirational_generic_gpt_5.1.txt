**SCENE 1**: Golden hour hits a glass tower; a young professional squints, blending into the crowd, outfit sharp, expression uncertain.  

**SCENE 2**: She opens her car door; SunVue Aviator Classics gleam on the seat, city skyline reflected in polarized lenses.  

**SCENE 3**: She slips them on in slow motion; golden light flares, streets sharpen, colors deepen, her posture straightens confidently.  

**SCENE 4**: Quick cuts: driving sunlit avenues, rooftop beach bar, airport walkway; same Aviators anchor her look, blocking glare with effortless cool.  

**SCENE 5**: She strides through a glowing crosswalk, Aviators hero-framed; SunVue logo appears beside them: “Never Hide. Own the moment.”
