**SCENE 1**: Urban professional steps out of glass office at golden hour, squinting against city glare, outfit stylish yet forgettable.  

**SCENE 2**: They spot SunVue Aviator Classics on a café table, thin metal frame and dark UV-polarized lenses catching sunset.  

**SCENE 3**: As they slide on the polarized shades, harsh glare melts away and the city snaps into deep, cinematic focus.  

**SCENE 4**: With every confident head turn, scenes shift—from convertible drive to beach walk to rooftop bar—frames always sharply heroed.  

**SCENE 5**: Close-up on SunVue logo at temple, city glowing in lenses, text appears: "SunVue Aviator Classic — Never Hide".
