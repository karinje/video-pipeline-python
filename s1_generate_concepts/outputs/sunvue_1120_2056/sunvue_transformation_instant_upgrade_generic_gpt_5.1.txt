**SCENE 3**: They open the SunVue case, slide on polarized, UV-shielding Aviator Classics, and the city sharpens into vivid, glare-free gold.

**SCENE 5**: Close-up on the lenses catching sunset skyline; text appears: SunVue Aviator Classic—polarized optical precision, iconic confidence, Never Hide.
