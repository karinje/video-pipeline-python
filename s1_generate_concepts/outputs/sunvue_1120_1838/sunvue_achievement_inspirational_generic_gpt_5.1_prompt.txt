## **AI VIDEO GENERATION CONTEXT**

### **IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:**

**DO:**
✓ Focus on emotional story first
✓ Use effects only if they enhance brand message
✓ Think "would this stop someone scrolling?"
✓ Consider platform (vertical for TikTok, square for Instagram)
✓ Create one memorable "signature moment"

**DON'T:**
✗ Force effects just because they're available
✗ Let effects overshadow the product (frames must be hero)
✗ Describe technical execution (save for script phase)
✗ Create complexity without purpose

**REMEMBER:** 
- Simple powerful story > Complex effects
- Effects should feel natural to the narrative
- Best AI ads use impossible visuals to amplify human emotions
- If traditional filming could achieve it easily, consider pushing further (but only if it serves the story)

**Example Integration (Subtle):**
Instead of: "Character walks to work"
Consider: "Character walks to work as city reflects in their lenses, each reflection showing different mood"

But also perfectly fine: "Character walks to work confidently in new frames" (if that serves the story better)

The goal is capturing attention and driving brand recall through whatever approach best serves your concept - whether that's emotional simplicity or visual innovation.

Create a concise 5-scene ad concept where the eyewear drives the story. Focus 70% on style/confidence/lifestyle transformation and 30% on practical benefits. Each sentence should be simple (15-20 words max) and describe what visually happens in that scene.

**EYEWEAR AD ESSENTIALS:**
- Frames must be clearly visible in at least 3 scenes
- Include one "putting on glasses" transformation moment
- Show how the frames elevate the wearer's style/confidence
- Make viewers think "I need those frames" not just "I need glasses"

**AD STYLE GUIDE:**
- **Humor**: Style mishaps, wrong frames comedy, personality changes with different glasses
- **Sentiment**: Frames through life moments, generational handoff, signature style stories
- **Achievement**: Glasses as confidence builder, power accessory, signature look discovery
- **Adventure**: Lifestyle frames, journey enabler, iconic moments in iconic glasses
- **Transformation**: Instant style upgrade, invisible to memorable, frames change everything
- **Perspective**: World through the lenses, POV transformation, vision meets style
- **Cinematic**: High-style visual feast, music video aesthetic, pure eyewear glamour
- **Mystique**: Frames as identity, power through mystery, signature look as character

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Write 5 simple scenes that could be explained in 1-2 minutes:

**SCENE 1**: [What happens - frames absent or problem setup]

**SCENE 2**: [What happens - discovery or challenge moment]

**SCENE 3**: [What happens - trying on or transformation beginning]

**SCENE 4**: [What happens - peak style moment or confidence transformation]

**SCENE 5**: [What happens - brand frames as solution, tagline moment]

Remember: The glasses are the hero that transforms the wearer's style and confidence, not just a functional tool.
