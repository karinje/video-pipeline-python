**SCENE 1**: Golden hour in the city; an urban professional squints against traffic glare, stylish but forgettable in the crowd.  

**SCENE 2**: He spots SunVue Aviator Classics in a boutique window, frames glowing in sunset reflections of skyline, cars, ocean.  

**SCENE 3**: As he puts them on, the world sharpens; polarized lenses erase glare while golden light ignites his confidence.  

**SCENE 4**: Match-cut moments: commanding a boardroom, cruising coastal highway, crossing airports—same Aviators, effortless Timeless Cool in every reflection.  

**SCENE 5**: Close-up 3D rotation of SunVue Aviator Classics over city skyline; he faces camera, unshaken, title appears: “Never Hide”.
