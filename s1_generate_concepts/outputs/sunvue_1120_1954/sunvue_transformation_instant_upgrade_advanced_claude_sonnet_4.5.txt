**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: The Aviator Classic becomes the catalyst for transformation, not just an accessory but the defining element that shifts how the world sees and responds to the wearer. Golden hour lighting makes the gold frames and G-15 lenses visually stunning while demonstrating the polarized function. The "Never Hide" tagline lands perfectly as the character goes from hiding in the crowd to commanding attention—all because they found their signature frames.
