**SCENE 1**: Golden hour in the city; an overworked professional squints against blinding glare, outfit sharp but expression drained.  

**SCENE 2**: They notice SunVue Aviator Classics glowing in a boutique window, lenses catching traffic streaks like liquid gold.  

**SCENE 3**: As they slide the aviators on, harsh reflections dissolve; streets warm, colors deepen, posture straightens with quiet defiance.  

**SCENE 4**: Rapid cuts: driving glare-free, beach shimmering in polarized detail, rooftop drinks, airport escalator—same SunVue frames anchoring effortless, timeless cool.  

**SCENE 5**: At sunset, their lenses mirror the skyline while copy reads "Polarized UV perfection," logo landing beneath: SunVue—Never Hide.
