**5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:

**SCENE 1**: An urban professional hurries through downtown at golden hour, squinting in harsh glare, blending into the rushing crowd.  

**SCENE 2**: They stop at a boutique window as gold metal Aviator Classics glow in warm light, deep green lenses magnetic.  

**SCENE 3**: Trying them on before the window, glare vanishes, city sharpens, posture lifts, eyes relaxed; their reflection now effortlessly, unmistakably confident.  

**SCENE 4**: Striding through streets and sliding into a car, heads turn as polarized lenses reveal crisp, glare-free views of glowing skyline.  

**SCENE 5**: On a rooftop terrace, they remove then snap Aviators back on, owning the skyline; SunVue logo, "Never Hide."
