**SCENE 1**: An overworked urban professional exits the office at golden hour, squinting against harsh city glare, looking forgettable.  

**SCENE 2**: They pause by a mirrored storefront, spotting SunVue Aviator Classics; in the reflection, a cooler, bolder self appears.  

**SCENE 3**: Close-up as they slide on the polarized Aviators; city glare dissolves, colors deepen, posture straightens into timeless cool confidence.  

**SCENE 4**: Quick cuts show them driving, boarding a flight, and walking a sunset beach, Aviator lenses reflecting skylines and admiring glances.  

**SCENE 5**: Final close-up: they lower the shades with a knowing half-smile, skyline reading "SunVue Polarized — Never Hide, Never Squint."
