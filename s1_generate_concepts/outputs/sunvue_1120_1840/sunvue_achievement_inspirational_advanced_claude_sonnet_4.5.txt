**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: Classic Aviators become the turning point between blending in and standing out. The transformation is instant and visible—wrong frames (or no frames) equal squinting uncertainty, while the right Aviators equal effortless professional cool. Golden hour lighting makes the G-15 lenses hero by showing dramatic glare elimination while the gold frames catch light beautifully.
