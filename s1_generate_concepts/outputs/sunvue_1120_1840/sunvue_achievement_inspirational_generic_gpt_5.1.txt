**SCENE 1**: Golden hour in the city; a young professional in a sharp suit exits, squinting as traffic glare overwhelms.  

**SCENE 2**: She pauses by her car; SunVue Aviator Classics rest on the dash, polarized lenses catching the molten skyline.  

**SCENE 3**: She slides them on; windshields lose blinding glare, colors deepen, and her reflection in the glass radiates new confidence.  

**SCENE 4**: Through the lenses, we glide between driving, beach, and city nights, her Aviators constant—signature look, unstoppable confidence.  

**SCENE 5**: SunVue logo appears over close-up rotating frames against glowing skyline: “Aviator Classic, polarized UV protection. Never Hide.”
