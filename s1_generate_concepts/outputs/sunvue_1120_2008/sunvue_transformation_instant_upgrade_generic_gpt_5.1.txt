**SCENE 1**: In rush-hour traffic, a young professional squints against harsh glare, city colors flat, face anonymous without sunglasses.  

**SCENE 2**: They spot a SunVue case on the console; it opens to reveal gleaming Aviator Classics, skyline reflected perfectly.  

**SCENE 3**: As they slide on the Aviator Classics, time slows and harsh glare melts into warm, polarized, UV-shielded golden-hour clarity.  

**SCENE 4**: Montage: their SunVue Aviators cut road and water glare as they drive, explore downtown, and toast sunset rooftops.  

**SCENE 5**: Crossing a glowing city crosswalk, their lenses mirror the skyline as text appears: SunVue Aviator Classic—Never Hide.
