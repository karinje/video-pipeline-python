**SCENE 2**: Reflection in storefront window catches their eye—classic gold Aviators displayed perfectly, sunlight glinting off metal frames, magnetic pull stops them.

**SCENE 3**: Inside boutique, they slide Aviators onto face, mirror reveals instant transformation, posture straightens, confident smirk emerges, they barely recognize themselves.

**SCENE 4**: Walking out onto street, city seems sharper through polarized lenses, people glance twice, stranger nods approval, confidence radiates with every step.
