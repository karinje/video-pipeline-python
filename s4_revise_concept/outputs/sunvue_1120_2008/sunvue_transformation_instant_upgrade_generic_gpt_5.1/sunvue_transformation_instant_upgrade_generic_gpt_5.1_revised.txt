**SCENE 1**: In rush-hour traffic, a young professional keeps their head down, avoiding eye contact with passing strangers—hiding behind uncertainty.

**SCENE 2**: They reach for a SunVue case on the console; it opens to reveal gleaming Aviator Classics, skyline reflected perfectly in the lenses.

**SCENE 3**: As they slide on the Aviator Classics, **Innerlight** radiates from within—time freezes, their eyes light up with newfound boldness, shoulders back, ready to face the world.

**SCENE 4**: Montage: they stride downtown making bold eye contact with strangers, confidently lead a rooftop pitch, laugh freely at sunset—fully present in every moment.

**SCENE 5**: Crossing a glowing city crosswalk with head held high, their lenses mirror the skyline as text appears: SunVue Aviator Classic—Never Hide.

**STANDOUT ELEMENTS:** The Innerlight effect during the transformation creates a visually impossible moment where inner confidence becomes literal visible radiance, perfectly capturing the "Never Hide" philosophy while leveraging AI video generation capabilities. The clear arc from literally hiding to boldly present in every interaction ties emotional transformation directly to the product's promise.
