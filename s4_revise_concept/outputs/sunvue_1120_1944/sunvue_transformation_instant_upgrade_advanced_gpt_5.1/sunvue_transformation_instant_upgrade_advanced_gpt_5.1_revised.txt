**5-SCENE AD CONCEPT**:  

**SCENE 1**:  
Someone exits a glass office tower at golden hour, squinting against harsh city glare, the world washed out in overexposed light.  

**SCENE 2**:  
Pulling Aviator Classic frames from a pocket, they catch the light—gold metal gleams, G-15 lenses shimmer with subtle green depth.  

**SCENE 3**:  
As frames slide on, [MELT TRANSITION]: the blurry, overexposed world liquefies and drips away like hot wax, revealing crystalline UV-protected clarity.  

**SCENE 4**:  
Now commanding the street, [GLOW TRACE]: golden trails follow subtle head movements; the city reflects crisply in anti-reflective lenses—traffic, skyline, sunset sharp and vivid.  

**SCENE 5**:  
Rooftop terrace at dusk: close-up on Aviators catching molten sky in G-15 lenses; [INNERLIGHT]: subtle radiance glows from within frames; text: SunVue Aviator Classic, Never Hide.
