**SCENE 1**: Urban professional steps out of glass office at golden hour, squinting against city glare, SunVue Aviators tucked in their bag, hesitant to wear them.

**SCENE 2**: A confident stranger in statement frames strides past—inspired, our hero finally slides on their own Aviator Classics, thin metal temples catching sunset light.

**SCENE 3**: As they settle the polarized shades, harsh glare liquefies away (Melt Transition) and the city snaps into deep, crystalline focus—everything sharper, more vivid.

**SCENE 4**: With every confident head turn, lenses reflect unexpected city moments—jazz musicians, neon murals, laughing couples—each frame beautifully heroed, their eyes subtly luminous (Luminous Gaze).

**SCENE 5**: Close-up on SunVue logo at temple, city glowing in lenses, text appears: "SunVue Aviator Classic — Never Hide."

**STANDOUT ELEMENTS:** This concept transforms eyewear advertising from aspirational luxury into an emotionally resonant courage narrative—the hero already owns the frames but needs inspiration to wear them, making "Never Hide" a powerful call to personal confidence rather than product discovery. The AI-enabled Melt Transition and Luminous Gaze effects create impossible, memorable visuals that elevate this from conventional to unforgettable.
