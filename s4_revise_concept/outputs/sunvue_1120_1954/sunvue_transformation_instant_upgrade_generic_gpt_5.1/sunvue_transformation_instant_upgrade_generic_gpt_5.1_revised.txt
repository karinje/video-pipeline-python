**SCENE 1**: Golden hour outside a glass tower; an executive grips their merger pitch folder, squinting against blinding reflections—sharp suit, but eyes averted, shoulders tense before the high-stakes presentation awaiting inside.

**SCENE 2**: Their fractured reflection in the tower glass suddenly aligns—locking eyes with their own steady gaze through SunVue Aviators displayed in an adjacent boutique window, the frames completing the missing piece.

**SCENE 3**: Aviators slide on with "Luminous Gaze" effect—their eyes glow powerfully through the lenses, not hidden but amplified; blinding glare dissolves to rich contrast, posture straightens, jaw sets with command.

**SCENE 4**: Decisive cuts: presenting to the backlit boardroom with piercing eye contact, driving into low-sun commute without flinching, holding a steady stare across negotiation tables, navigating reflective city corridors—no longer squinting or avoiding.

**SCENE 5**: At sunset, they turn to face the camera directly through the lenses—eyes clearly visible and commanding, making unbroken contact; skyline reflects across frames as copy reads "Polarized UV perfection"—logo: SunVue—Never Hide.

**STANDOUT ELEMENTS:** The "Luminous Gaze" effect transforms sunglasses from concealment into amplification of confidence and presence, while replacing generic luxury moments with specific glare-challenge victories (backlit boardroom, negotiation stares) grounds the transformation in relatable purpose—culminating in direct-to-camera eye contact that proves "Never Hide" means facing everything without flinching.
