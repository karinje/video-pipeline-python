**SCENE 3**: In lobby mirror, they slide on SunVue Aviators; the washed-out world liquefies and drips away (Melt Transition), revealing crystalline clarity and sharp colors as posture straightens into effortless confidence.

**SCENE 4**: Back in sun-drenched streets, they navigate with effortless ease while others squint and retreat to shadows—polarized lenses revealing every detail with clarity.

**AUDIENCE JOURNEY**: Viewers feel how slipping on SunVue Aviators turns everyday city grind into a standout, golden-hour signature presence while others fade into the background.

**WHY THIS WORKS FOR EYEWEAR**: The Aviator Classics remain the clear hero, now with an impossible melting-world transformation that showcases AI video capabilities while demonstrating polarized lens clarity. The "Never Hide" ethos is strengthened through Scene 4's visual contrast—the protagonist navigates harsh glare confidently while others literally retreat to shadows, showing both functional superiority and attitudinal boldness without relying on validation-seeking clichés.

**TAGLINE/END CARD**: Hero shot of SunVue Aviator Classic against glowing skyline, G-15 lenses reflecting the city. Lockup: **SunVue** logo + **"Never Hide."**

**STANDOUT ELEMENTS**: The liquefying world transformation (Melt Transition effect) creates an impossible, memorable visual that only AI video generation can achieve—turning the ordinary moment of putting on sunglasses into a reality-bending experience. The inverted confidence dynamic in Scene 4, where the protagonist boldly embraces harsh sunlight while others retreat to shadows, powerfully demonstrates both product benefit and brand attitude without resorting to predictable "heads turning" validation.
