          "explanation": "This concept delivers a solid transformation narrative with clear visual progression and strong brand integration. The golden hour aesthetic and urban professional journey are compelling, though the execution leans toward familiar luxury advertising tropes rather than breakthrough memorability. The AI potential for glare-to-clarity transitions and reflective lens effects is present but could be pushed further.",

            "Excellent narrative arc with clear transformation from invisible commuter to confident urban professional across all 5 scenes",

            "Natural brand integration where the Aviators are the catalyst for change, not just a product placement",
            "Specific technical features (polarized G-15, UV protection) demonstrated through visual storytelling rather than exposition",
